FreezeGrid is a jQuery plugin that will take a table and give it the ability to have frozen columns/and or rows.  (Or at least that's my goal.)

I have successfully created a non-plugin version of this code on a live, but private application and thought I'd try to reproduce here on github.  My JavaScript expertese is intermediate and so I expect people to find lots of problems and areas to improve on my code.  If you're so inclined, contact me at benleewilliams@gmail.com.
